# CI/CD Pipeline
#
# Calls the reusable Dagger pipeline from github-meta.
# All CI/CD logic is centralized there - this file just triggers it.
#
# The workflow handles:
# - Linting and type checking
# - Running tests
# - Building container with `deno compile`
# - Publishing to GHCR
# - Deploying to Cloud Run
